# Image-segmentation-and-extraction

This project demonstrates how to use image processing techniques to segment and extract objects from an image. The project uses MATLAB to implement the following steps:

1.Read the image.
2.Convert the image to grayscale.
3.Convert the image to binary using a threshold.
4.Remove all objects containing fewer than 30 pixels.
5.Label connected components.
6.Measure the properties of the image regions.
7.Plot bounding boxes around the objects.
8.Extract the objects from the image.
The project can be used to extract objects from a variety of images.The project is also useful for learning about image processing concepts such as thresholding, connected component labeling, and region properties measurement.
